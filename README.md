# Load Data From Lazy Page by Selenium
## Description

This project contains the source code to load all data from a lazy page using Selenium in Python.

A lazy page is a web page that loads its content dynamically, as the user scrolls or interacts with the page. This can make it difficult to extract data from the page using traditional methods, such as scraping.

Selenium is a tool that allows you to automate web browser interactions. This makes it possible to load all of the content on a lazy page and extract the data you need.

The source code in this project demonstrates how to use Selenium to load all data from a lazy page. The code is written in Python and can be used with Chrome browser.
